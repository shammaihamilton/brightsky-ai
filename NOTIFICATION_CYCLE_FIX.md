# Extension Context Loss - Notification Cycle Fix

## Problem Fixed
The extension was showing a continuous cycle where:
1. Extension reloads → Widget appears briefly → Context check fails → Notification shows
2. User clicks notification → Page refreshes → Extension loads → Widget appears → Context fails again
3. This created an endless loop of notifications appearing and disappearing

## Root Cause
The context checking was happening too quickly after page initialization, before the extension had time to properly establish its context. This caused false positives in context loss detection.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Smart Timing and Delays
```typescript
// Different delays based on page state
const isPageRefresh = sessionStorage.getItem('extensionRefreshing') === 'true';
const initialDelay = isPageRefresh ? 8000 : 5000; // Longer delay after refresh
const widgetDelay = isPageRefresh ? 2000 : 500;   // Widget creation delay
```

### 2. Refresh Cycle Prevention
```typescript
// Store refresh state to avoid immediate checks after refresh
sessionStorage.setItem('extensionRefreshing', 'true');

// Check for refresh state and delay notification accordingly
if (sessionStorage.getItem('extensionRefreshing') === 'true') {
  sessionStorage.removeItem('extensionRefreshing');
  setTimeout(() => this.showContextError(), 5000);
  return;
}
```

### 3. Extended Check Intervals
- **Initial delay**: 5-8 seconds (instead of 2 seconds)
- **Periodic checks**: 30 seconds (instead of 15 seconds)
- **Notification duration**: 20 seconds (instead of 12 seconds)

### 4. Widget Hiding on Context Loss
```typescript
// Immediately hide widget when context is lost
const widgetRoot = document.getElementById('floating-widget-root');
if (widgetRoot) {
  widgetRoot.style.display = 'none';
}
```

### 5. Improved User Experience
- **Clearer messaging**: "Extension Reloaded - Widget temporarily unavailable"
- **Longer visibility**: Notification stays visible for 20 seconds
- **Better click handling**: Stores refresh state before reloading page

## Technical Changes

### ExtensionContext.ts
- Added refresh state detection using sessionStorage
- Increased notification duration from 12s to 20s
- Added delayed notification logic for page refreshes
- Improved notification messaging

### FloatingWidget/index.tsx
- Extended initial delay from 2s to 5-8s based on page state
- Increased periodic check interval from 15s to 30s
- Added widget hiding on context loss
- Smart timing based on refresh state

### content/index.tsx
- Added delayed widget initialization (0.5s-2s based on page state)
- Improved context validation before widget creation

## Benefits Achieved
- ✅ **No more notification cycles**: Refresh state tracking prevents loops
- ✅ **Proper initialization time**: Extension gets adequate time to establish context
- ✅ **Better user experience**: Clearer messaging and longer notification duration
- ✅ **Intelligent timing**: Different delays for fresh loads vs page refreshes
- ✅ **Immediate feedback**: Widget hides immediately when context is lost
- ✅ **Development friendly**: Handles extension reloads gracefully without spam

## Expected Behavior Now
1. **Extension reload**: Widget appears and remains functional
2. **Context loss**: Widget immediately hides, single notification appears
3. **User clicks notification**: Page refreshes cleanly without immediate new notifications
4. **After refresh**: Extension initializes properly with adequate delay

This solution eliminates the notification cycle while maintaining proper error handling for genuine extension context loss scenarios.
