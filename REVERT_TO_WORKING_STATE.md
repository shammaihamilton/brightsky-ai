# Successfully Reverted to Pre-AI Services Refactoring

## What We Did
Reverted the codebase to commit `6eb06ac` - "Rename ModularSettingsPanel to SettingsPanel" which was the last stable commit before the AI services refactoring that caused the extension context issues.

## Current State
- ✅ **Reverted to commit**: `6eb06ac6b53ad64ec1628e0503b2f16404b34303`
- ✅ **Extension builds successfully**: No TypeScript errors
- ✅ **Original AI service**: Simple, working `aiService.ts` without complex SOLID refactoring
- ✅ **Original extension context**: Simple context checking without aggressive monitoring
- ✅ **No complex AI architecture**: No `src/services/ai/` directory with multiple providers

## Expected Behavior
The extension should now work exactly as it did before, with:
- Stable widget that doesn't disappear during extension reloads
- Simple extension context error handling
- No "Extension context lost, cleaning up widget" spam
- Single, clean AI service implementation

## Next Steps
1. **Reload the extension in Chrome**: 
   - Go to `chrome://extensions/`
   - Toggle your extension off and on
   - Or remove and re-add it from the `dist` folder

2. **Test the widget**:
   - Navigate to any webpage
   - Verify the widget appears and functions correctly
   - Test extension reload to ensure no notification spam

3. **If issues persist**:
   - Clear browser cache with Ctrl+Shift+R
   - Check Chrome DevTools console for any remaining errors

## Files Restored
- `src/services/aiService.ts` - Original simple implementation
- `src/utils/extensionContext.ts` - Simple context checking
- `src/components/FloatingWidget/index.tsx` - Original widget without aggressive context monitoring
- All other files reverted to working state

---

The extension should now behave exactly as it did before the AI services refactoring, with stable and reliable functionality.
